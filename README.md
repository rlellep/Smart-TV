> **[← Back to main Moonfin project](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client)**

Moonfin is an enhanced Jellyfin client built with the **Enact/Sandstone framework**, optimized for Samsung Smart TVs (Tizen) and LG Smart TVs (webOS). A single shared codebase powers both platforms with native video pipelines tuned for each.

## Features & Enhancements

Moonfin builds on the solid foundation of Jellyfin with targeted improvements for the TV viewing experience.

### Hardware-Accelerated Video Playback
- **Samsung AVPlay** (Tizen) and **Starfish/HTML5** (webOS) native video pipelines
- Smooth playback with proper hardware decoding for H.264, HEVC, HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision (where supported)
- Automatic DirectPlay → native transcode → hls.js fallback chain when a format isn't natively supported
- Enhanced player controls optimized for TV remote navigation

### Multi-Server & Unified Library Mode
- **Unified Library Mode** — Combine content from all connected Jellyfin servers into a single view
- Browse, search, and play content across multiple servers seamlessly
- Server badges show content origin when unified mode is enabled
- Cross-server playback with proper progress tracking per server
- Favorites, genres, and search aggregate results from all servers

### Jellyseerr Integration

Moonfin is the first smart TV client with native Jellyseerr support.

### Improved Details Screen
- Metadata organized into clear sections: genres, directors, writers, studios, and runtime
- Taglines displayed above the description where available
- Cast photos appear as circles for a cleaner look
- Fits more useful information on screen without feeling cramped
- **Playlist Management** — Add any item to an existing playlist or create a new one directly from the details screen; reorder items with the left/right keys and remove them with Delete

### UI Polish

## Installation

### Pre-built Releases

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Smart-TV/releases).

| Platform | File | Supported Devices |
|---|---|---|
| **Tizen Regular** | `Moonfin_Tizen_Regular_*.wgt` | Samsung Smart TVs (2017+, square icon) |
| **Tizen Oblong** | `Moonfin_Tizen_Oblong_*.wgt` | Samsung Smart TVs (2017+, oblong icon) |
| **Tizen Legacy** | `Moonfin_Tizen_Legacy_*.wgt` | Samsung Smart TVs (2016, Tizen 2.4) |
| **webOS** | `Moonfin_webOS_*.ipk` | LG Smart TVs (2016+, webOS 3.0+) |

### Sideloading — Samsung (Tizen)

The easiest way to install on Samsung TVs is using the **Jellyfin 2 Samsung** tool:

1. Download [Jellyfin 2 Samsung](https://github.com/PatrickSt1991/Samsung-Jellyfin-Installer) by [@PatrickSt1991](https://github.com/PatrickSt1991)
2. Enable Developer Mode on your Samsung TV:
   - Go to **Settings → General → System Manager → Developer Mode**
   - Turn Developer Mode **ON**
   - Enter your PC's IP address
   - Restart the TV
3. Run the tool, select the Moonfin `.wgt` file, enter your TV's IP address, and install

### Sideloading — LG (webOS)

1. Enable Developer Mode on your LG TV via the [LG Developer portal](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/getting-started/developer-mode-app)
2. Install the webOS CLI tools (`@webos-tools/cli`)
3. Set up your TV as a device: `ares-setup-device`
4. Install the IPK: `ares-install --device <your-tv> moonfin.ipk`

### Seerr/Jellyseerr Setup (Optional)

Seerr/Jellyseerr integration uses the **Moonfin Jellyfin Plugin** to proxy requests through your Jellyfin server, avoiding CORS and cookie issues on TV webviews.

1. Install the [Moonfin Plugin](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Plugin) on your Jellyfin server
2. Configure the plugin with your Seerr/Jellyseerr server URL and API key in the Jellyfin admin dashboard
3. In Moonfin on your TV, go to **Settings → PLugin** and enable the integration — no additional URL or key entry is needed on the TV side, it connects through your Jellyfin server automatically

> **Note:** The plugin acts as a server-side proxy, so your TV only needs to reach your Jellyfin server. Seerr/Jellyseerr does not need to be directly accessible from the TV.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ and npm 10+

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for Samsung — all variants (Regular, Oblong, Legacy) in one command
npm run build:tizen:all

# Build for Samsung — individual variants
npm run build:tizen         # Regular
npm run build:tizen:oblong  # Oblong (512x423 launcher icon)
npm run build:tizen:legacy  # Legacy (Tizen 2.4, no Smart Hub Preview)

# Build for LG (creates .ipk)
npm run build:webos

# Development server (Tizen mode)
npm run dev:tizen

# Development server (webOS mode)
npm run dev:webos
```

Build outputs:
- Tizen: `Moonfin_Tizen_<Regular|Oblong|Legacy>_<version>.wgt` in the project root
- webOS: `Moonfin_webOS_<version>.ipk` in the project root

## Development

This project uses **npm workspaces** and **Enact** to share a single React codebase across both platforms while keeping platform-specific code isolated.

└── .eslintrc.js              # Shared ESLint config
```

### Platform Abstraction

Shared code in `packages/app/` never imports directly from `@enact/webos`, `tizen.*`, or `webapis.*`. Platform-specific behavior is isolated through runtime detection:

```js
import { isTizen, isWebOS, getPlatform } from './platform';
```

Services like video, storage, and device profiles use `getPlatform()` to dynamically import the correct platform implementation at runtime.

### Developer Notes
- **Enact/Sandstone** provides TV-optimized UI components and Spotlight navigation
- **Tizen**: AVPlay API for video, `tizen.tvinputdevice` for remote keys
- **webOS**: Shared HTML5 video element with `audioTracks` API, Luna service calls for storage
- Packaged apps (`.wgt` / `.ipk`) bypass CORS restrictions
- Cross-origin cookies don't persist in either platform's webview — use API keys instead
- UI changes should be tested on actual TV hardware when possible
